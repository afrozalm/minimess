# MINIMESS

The goal of this project is for me to learn making an async messaging platform using go concurrency, websockets, and kafka. This project should prepare components that can run on a single laptop. Scaling is not the top priority here.

## 游릭 Phase 1

### Server related 1

We first setup a server which listens on port 8080 for ws connections

* the server will send "success"
* the server will send timestamps every few seconds
* close connection when client is inactive

### Client related

* will connect to the server
* will print messages it receives from the server

## 游릭 Phase 2

### Server related 2

* support channels
* create an API to subscribe to a topic

the client will listen to topic
/subscribe/id:`<uid>`/topic:`<topic>`

* clients that are newly subscribed to a topic will only receive new messages
* use fanout to broadcast
* have one go routine per connection
* inter goroutine communicate via go channels
* create a shared struct between the separate goroutines
* decouple writer, reader, pinger, ponger
* topics mapping will be stored in mem and will be broadcased immediately - the serve* will not store messages for now

## Client related 2

make an interactive client that looks something like below

```bash
> sub afrozalm
> send zorfa What\'s up Zorfa
> send mala How ya doin\' Mala
> zorfa: I\'m fantastic. Learning some magic tricks.
> mala: Just finished RoW. My mind is blow into millions of pieces. BrandoSando is legend
> unsub afrozalm
```

## 游리 Phase 3 goals

* 游릭 Figure out why the messages to this long to arrive client
* Improve Logging.
  * have multiple log levels
  * control log levels via cli flags
* update client to be able to attach to a channel and send messages there

## Future Goals

* Use thrift
* use kafka
* use nginx

### misc goals

* try out domain model by [Kat](https://github.com/katzien/go-structure-examples)
